# Odin - Library

Project provided by [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

In this (Assignment)[https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library#assignment] I was asked to create a simple object array and refresh the page each update to reflect the changes.
Since it is a resource-heavy task, I've decided to go a different route; I wanted to find a way to reflect the changes without rerendering the whole page.
Thus, I manged to achive the said goal by utilizing the function's execution context and context binding, coupled with a Map data structure instead of a simple array to store the book objects.
This project is NOT optimized for mobile use since the objective was to put the JS skills to the test.

Be sure to check out the commit history for reference, it's not that cluttered ;)
